## Features

### Broken end spikes
Destroying end crystals will convert nearby obsidian to crying obsidian and spawn endermites or phantoms

### Falling out of the end
When you fall out of the End dimension, instead of dying to void damage you will get teleported to the same position in the overworld.
The mod ensures you will still die, even when landing in water

### Invulnerable To Beds
Beds no longer harm the ender dragon while its **sitting**, **landing** or **charging**

### Dragon Breath
The Ender Dragon's breath attack has been amplified, becoming significantly larger and more destructive. 
Staying in the breath increases its size, so its important to leave as fast as possible

### Respawning end spikes
Depending on player count and player deaths, end spikes may regenerate

### Overhauled flight paths
The algorithm for the flight paths has been rewritten. I do not like the new paths just yet, as they have some weird quirks, but they are definitely an improvement

### Miscellaneous

- **Modified Hitboxes** for the ender dragon and phantoms spawed in the end

- **Modified Knockback:** for the ender dragon

- For testing, the `/ready` command will teleport you to the end with appropriate equipment


## Mod Compatibility

Total Dragon is balanced for gameplay with the mod [Combat Roll](https://modrinth.com/mod/combat-roll). 
While vanilla or alternative mods can be utilized, configuration adjustments will be necessary for a fair experience

## Disclaimer

Total Dragon is still in alpha
